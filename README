# Sales Analysis Project

This project performs various analyses on a sales dataset using Python, Pandas, and SQL-like queries through the `pandasql` library.

## Project Overview

The project aims to extract meaningful insights from a sales dataset, such as revenue per category, age group revenue, monthly profits, total items sold, and total revenue. Additionally, it identifies the top 5 products by revenue.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pandas library
- Pandasql library

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.

2. Install the required libraries using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas pandasql
   ```

3. Ensure that the `Sales.csv` file is in the same directory as your script.

## Usage

1. Import the necessary libraries and define the function to run SQL queries:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   from pandasql import sqldf

   run_query = lambda query: sqldf(query, globals())
   ```

2. Load the CSV file into a DataFrame:

   ```python
   df = pd.read_csv('Sales.csv')
   ```

3. Display the first few rows of the DataFrame and check for missing values:

   ```python
   print(df.head())
   print(df.isna().sum())
   ```

4. Execute various queries to analyze the sales data:

   - **Revenue per Product Category:**

     ```python
     query_1 = '''
     SELECT SUM(revenue) AS Total_Revenue, Product_Category
     FROM df
     GROUP BY Product_Category
     '''
     Revenue_per_Category = run_query(query_1)
     print(Revenue_per_Category)
     ```

   - **Revenue per Age Group:**

     ```python
     query_2 = '''
     SELECT SUM(revenue) AS Total_Revenue, Age_Group
     FROM df
     GROUP BY Age_Group
     '''
     Revenue_per_Age = run_query(query_2)
     print(Revenue_per_Age)
     ```

   - **Monthly Profits:**

     ```python
     query_3 = '''
     SELECT SUM(Profit) AS Total_Profit, Month
     FROM df
     GROUP BY Month
     '''
     Monthly_Profits = run_query(query_3)
     print(Monthly_Profits)
     ```

   - **Total Order Quantity and Total Revenue:**

     ```python
     query_4 = '''
     SELECT SUM(Order_Quantity) AS Total_Quantity, SUM(Revenue) AS Total_Revenue
     FROM df
     '''
     Items_Sold = run_query(query_4)
     print(Items_Sold)
     ```

   - **Top 5 Products by Revenue:**

     ```python
     query_5 = '''
     SELECT Product, SUM(Revenue) AS Total_Revenue
     FROM df
     GROUP BY Product
     ORDER BY Total_Revenue DESC
     LIMIT 5
     '''
     Top_5_Products = run_query(query_5)
     print(Top_5_Products)

     ```

## Outputs

The project provides the following insights:

- Total revenue per product category.
- Total revenue per age group.
- Monthly profits.
- Total quantity of items sold and total revenue.
- Top 5 products by revenue.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to perform data analysis on a sales dataset using Python, Pandas, and SQL-like queries. The insights obtained can help in understanding sales trends and making informed business decisions.
